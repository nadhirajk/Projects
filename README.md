# Projects
This repository hosts completed past projects (mostly academic work for data science and computer science courses).

AdaBoost Computational Statistics Project:
Provides a rigorous, academic introduction to AdaBoost and related techniques, and applies the algorithms to an example dataset.

Kaggle Credit Project:
My team's entry for the Kaggle competition Give Me Some Credit. We predict the probability a given borrower
will default on a loan, given information about the borrowerâ€™s financial circumstances and credit history.
The report describes the data cleaning, processing, and analysis processes. Our final model was a random forest trained on a weighted
subset of the training data.

Poker Hand Strength Project:
My partner and I's project for our Discrete Mathematical Modelling class at Claremont Graduate University. We built a model for the game of Texas Hold'Em Poker and implementented, analysed, and compared algorithms to evaluate the strength of a poker hand at various stages of the game.
